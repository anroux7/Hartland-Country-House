            While the bathroom is not en-suite, it is conveniently located just opposite the room and
            features a spacious shower, perfect for a refreshing experience after a day of exploring.
            The room is equipped with both an air conditioner and a fan, ensuring comfort during the
            summer months, while ample natural light fills the room, creating a warm and welcoming
            atmosphere.

          <p>
            Please note that there are no TVs in the room, as we believe Hartland is a sanctuary
            designed to help you disconnect from the world and reconnect with nature and your loved ones.
